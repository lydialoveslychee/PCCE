## New Features

   - Users can replace part of their items with all the exclusive items (or selected types) to their save file by clicking "ChangeAll" button instead of editing one by one.

   - However, please make sure that you have enough unnecessary items to be replaced(maybe use the complete tickets to buy some cookies and eat them to get enough items). Otherwise, unpredictable error may occurs.
